I want you to help me write a spec file for a project i am building. its called "hookhub". Its a place where cool open source claude hooks are displayed and browsed. search on claude hooks and write an initial spec for this. remember its an MVP ATM and we need only functionality of displaying the hooks. Hooks are found in github repository, they have name, category, description and link to repo. the main page should display the hooks in a grid like view.
