# HookHub — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement HookHub — a curated web directory of open-source Claude Code hooks.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — 5 milestone instructions (foundation + 4 sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, design tokens (sky/indigo/zinc, Poppins/Roboto/JetBrains Mono)
- `data-model/` — Core entities (Hook, PurposeCategory, LifecycleEvent) and TypeScript types
- `shell/` — Application shell components (AppShell, HeroBanner, PageFooter)
- `sections/` — 4 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`) — includes design tokens, data model, routing, and application shell
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

**Section order:**
| Milestone | Section | ID |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| 01 | Foundation | — |
| 02 | Landing & Hero | `landing-and-hero` |
| 03 | Hook Catalog | `hook-catalog` |
| 04 | Filter System | `filter-system` |
| 05 | Dark & Light Mode | `dark-and-light-mode` |

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes to the prompt
4. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
5. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
6. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, etc.).

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about data sources, hosting, and tech stack.
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed.
- **Build on your designs** — Use completed sections as the starting point for future feature development.
- **Review thoroughly** — Check plans and implementations carefully to catch details and inconsistencies.
- **Fill in the gaps** — Backend data enrichment (GitHub API), deployment, and analytics need manual decisions.
